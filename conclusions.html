        <h1>Conclusions</h1>

        <p>A conclusion of project lies not on the idea of what, if anything, can be specifically and objectively ascertained from each of the films as case studies through the use of these methods. A conclusion rests on the fact these methods offer a process for further visual study, rather than a tangible product or conclusive statement. The utilitarian nature of the process is what should be centered and drawn from this project.</p>

        <p>Centuries-old empirical methods of acquiring knowledge such as the scientific method, which many students are taught at a young age, have taught us to prioritize conclusivity, ascertainty, and pass-fail notions of hypothesizing. For the purposes of this project, I propose moving forward from this structure of inquiry, hence the type of conclusion I draft here. The purpose of my conclusion is not to reject the scientific method of inquiry and methods of drawing specific conclusions from works. I believe this may be productive for other studies, however, I aim for my conclusion to accept a non-definitive nature.</p>

        <p>For example, using the frameworks within this project, researchers can study use of color, frames, image, and philosophical understandings of time and its relation to time-based media such as film. For example, through the use of IMJ, we can visually depict sequences within a film and visualize its relation to the entirety of the given work. (See example featuring Hollis Frampton's <i>(nostalgia)</i> on the About page, which allowed us to see all 13 sequences at once.) Various researchers can use the methods proposed through this digital humanities framework for viewing and engaging with these works for their own personalized further studies. These specific studies then depend on a researcher's own needs and proposed inquiries, and they can then form their own conclusions. Just as other projects I've mentioned have paved the way for my work, this is on each and every one of us as researchers and viewers of film to expand this approach and potentially accept a new way of visual understanding.</p>

        <p>Using the processes here, we're able to determine that there is more about frames than meets the eye. What is a frame? What new meanings can we draw from its traditionally rectangular figure? What happens when we interrogate and question the form and widely adapted nature of this four-cornered structure? And most importantly, what other means of viewing frames remain? I belieive indeterminacy remains and that new methods of viewing frames may arise in the future.</p>
