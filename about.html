        <p><i><h3>“No longer should we be bound to cinema as truth that exists within the fleeting 24 frames per second. We instead should make as many frames as we like and hold them in our hands for as long as we want.”</h3></i></p>

        <br>

        <p><i>Indeterminable Frames</i> is aims to re-examine the moving image using the field of digital humanities and its intersection with film and media studies. It seeks to find a new understanding of moving image works, explore the visual qualities of what lies within the rectangular frames, and interrogate our traditional understanding of frames and their sequential formation of moving image works. By translating films into visual captasets, we can derive an alternative visualization of a work.
        <br>
        <br>
        The visualizations in this project present a new form of film and media analysis. This project seeks not to define these methods of viewing and interacting with film as a new, "absolute truth" for film spectatorship but proposes the methods used as a form that warrants more critical investigation and discussion. Related scholarship and projects such as Kevin L. Ferguson's <a href="http://mediacommons.org/intransition/2015/03/10/volumetric-cinema" target="_blank">"Volumetric Cinema"</a> and Dave Rodriguez's <a href="https://drodz11.github.io/particlesinspace/" target="_blank"><i>Particles in Space</i></a> and <a href="https://drodz11.github.io/colors-of-ozu/" target="_blank"><i>Colors of Ozu</i></a> have contributed to these ideas in a similar vein. I aim to continue the ethos of their work and similar ideas they have brought forward, while intersecting other modes of scholarship.</p>

        <h2>Background and Foundations</h2>
        
        <p>This project is grounded within an intersection of moving image works, histories, disciplines, and theoretical works by a range of scholars. I ground <i>Indetermininable Frames</i> within the practice of deformance, moving image works as capta, and revisualization through digital means as a continuation of aura.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>A Very Brief History of the Moving Image</h3>
        <p>Studies of the moving image started as early as the late 1800s, with experiments in protocinematic devices such as magic lanterns, zoetropes, flip books, and phenakistiscopes. While the devices had variations in design and technical components, they all contributed to the formation of the persistence of vision&mdash;an optical illusion creating the illusion of motion perceivable by the human eye and cognitive mind. Centuries-old science in the study of the camera obscura, a precursor to the optics of modern day cameras, also contributed to the idea images could be projected by light and enjoyed by broader audiences.
        <br>
        <br>
        With ongoing advancements in manufacturing, Eastman Kodak was able to make celluloid film strips first commercially available in 1889. The birth of 16mm film by Eastman Kodak in 1923, a less expensive alternative more accessible to amateurs, changed the consumer market and professional industry for the decades to come. It is important to distinguish that the foundation of the moving image is itself an accumulation of individual still-images, hereby  known as frames, brought together to depict movement.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>A Practice of Deformance</h3>

        <p>Those familiar with celluloid film mediums (16mm, 8mm, Super 8, 35mm, etc.)&mdash;a medium all of the works presented within <i>Indeterminable Frames</i> were originally created with&mdash;can argue a translation of a physical celluloid form with a frame-by-frame light projected structure and a specific frames per second exposure rate as determined by the original filmmaker is translated into a new form when the film is digitized, created into new "frames" via tools such as FFmpeg, and then (re)presented here. I agree. However, I do not believe these ways of viewing or the practices conducted within this project are inherently reductive, as some may argue.  
        <br>
        <br>
        The analysis for this project utilizes the critical practice of <i>deformance</i> as defined by Jerome McGann and Lisa Samuels in their article "Deformance and Interpretation." Deformance is the act of disrupting or re-organizing a work's original order to bring to attention possibilities of meaning not seen otherwise. The methods used allow both scholars and audiences to consider new avenues for exploration within film and media studies and continue an ongoing conversation in this practice.</p>
        
        <br>
        <h3>Moving Image Works as Capta</h3>
        <p>According to scientific method approaches to inquiry, we can equate the accumulation of derived still-images from these moving image works as our "datasets." However, Johanna Drucker's definition of <i>data as capta</i> provides a more suitable definition for the inquiry conducted within this project. According to Drucker, "humanistic inquiry acknowledges the situated, partical, and consitutive character of knowledge production, the recognition that knowledge is constructed, taken, not simply given as a natural representation of a pre-existing fact." Data is assumed to be a "given"&mdash;recorded and observed; capta is "taken" actively&mdash;to engage and analyze. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The use of capta per Drucker's definition grounds the use of the moving image work case studies first and foremost as <i>artist-made works</i> used primarily to answer humanities-based questions about film as aesthetic works. In addition, understanding data as an active process rather than having a passive existence is key to our interpretation of these works within the analysis. It allows the works to keep their visual and historical richness inherent to their existence during the process of inquiry rather than being reduced to static objects for the sake of digital technicality.</p> 
        <br>
        
        <h3>Reproductions vs. Revisualizations</h3>

        <p>In the vein of Walter Benjamin's line of thought on works of art in the age of technological reproducibility, the process of inquiry proposed here <i>does not aim to reproduce the works</i>, therefore works in question keep their distinct auras. The visual elements included here are what I define as <i>revisualizations</i>, rather than reproductions. Revisualization illustrates there are more visible qualities to understand about these works, and this is where the digital humanities can step in and help fill a gap.</p>
       <br>
       <h2>Frames, "Frames," and Still-Images</h2> 

       <p>It is important to distinguish between the language used here.... I claim that the frames are intederminable by nature, hence the namesake of this project.
