        <p><i>Indeterminable Frames</i> is aims to explore a method of re-examining the moving image using the field of digital humanities and its intersection with film and media studies. It seeks to expand our understanding of moving image works, explore the visual qualities of what lies within the ubiquitous rectangular frames, and interrogate our traditional understanding of frames and their traditionally sequential formation of moving image works.</p>

        <p>Alternative media theorist Gene Youngblood argued in his seminal book <i>Expanded Cinema</i> for an expansion of the notion of cinema in order to develop a new vision and form of consciousness. He claimed aesthetic application of technology would be the only means of achieving new consciousness to match our new environment in the present-age. By translating films into visual captasets, we can derive an alternative visualization of a work and a new understanding of cinema.</p>

        <p>The visualizations in this project present a new form of film and media analysis, and thus, avenues for a new consciousness. This project seeks not to define these methods of viewing and interacting with film as a new, "absolute truth" for film spectatorship but proposes the methods used as a form that warrants more critical investigation, use, and ongoing discussion.</p>

        <p>Related scholarship and projects such as Kevin L. Ferguson's <a href="http://mediacommons.org/intransition/2015/03/10/volumetric-cinema" target="_blank">"Volumetric Cinema"</a> claimed we should no longer be bound to cinema as truth that exists within the fleeting 24 frames per second. Rather, we should be able to hold and grasp frames as long as we want. Dave Rodriguez's <a href="https://drodz11.github.io/particlesinspace/" target="_blank"><i>Particles in Space</i></a> and <a href="https://drodz11.github.io/colors-of-ozu/" target="_blank"><i>Colors of Ozu</i></a> continued the ideas of his work and raised important and relevant questions. I aim to continue the ethos of their work and similar ideas they have brought forward, while intersecting other frameworks.</p>

        <h2>Background and Foundations</h2>

        <p>This project is grounded within an intersection of moving image works, histories, disciplines, and theoretical works by a range of scholars. I ground <i>Indetermininable Frames</i> within four foundations: the history of the moving image, the practice of deformance, moving image works as capta, and revisualization through digital means as a continuation of aura.</p>

        <h3>A Very Brief History of the Moving Image</h3>
        <p>Studies of the moving image started as early as the late 1800s, with experiments in protocinematic devices such as magic lanterns, zoetropes, flip books, and phenakistiscopes. While the devices had variations in design and technical components, they all contributed to the formation of the persistence of vision&mdash;an optical illusion creating the illusion of motion perceivable by the human eye and cognitive mind. Centuries-old science in the study of the camera obscura, a precursor to the optics of modern day cameras, also contributed to the idea images could be projected by light and enjoyed by broader audiences.
        <br>
        <br>
        With ongoing advancements in manufacturing, Eastman Kodak was able to make celluloid film strips first commercially available in 1889. The birth of 16mm film by Eastman Kodak in 1923, a less expensive alternative more accessible to amateurs, changed the consumer market and professional industry for the decades to come. It is important to distinguish that the foundation of the moving image is itself <i>an accumulation of individual still-images, hereby  known as frames, brought together to depict movement</i>. See <b>Figure 2</b> for an example of individual frames in 16mm film.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>A Practice of Deformance</h3>

        <p>Given the aforementioned knowledge and the physical qualities of film as a celluloid medium, it can be argued a translation of a physical celluloid form with a frame-by-frame light projected structure and a specific frames per second exposure rate as determined by the original filmmaker is translated into a new form when the film is digitized, created into new "frames" via tools such as FFmpeg, and then (re)presented here. I agree. However, I do not believe these ways of viewing or the practices conducted within this project are inherently reductive, as some may argue.
        <br>
        <br>
        The analysis for this project utilizes the critical practice of <i>deformance</i> as defined by Jerome McGann and Lisa Samuels in their article "Deformance and Interpretation." Deformance is the act of disrupting or re-organizing a work's original order to bring to attention possibilities of meaning not seen otherwise. Through the use of the digital tools in this project, we conduct deformance to allow a new approach of experiencing and understanding to come into fruition.
        <br>
        <br>
        The methods used allow both scholars and audiences to consider new avenues for exploration within film and media studies and continue an ongoing conversation in this practice. While viewing a celluloid film projected in its analog form versus as a scanned and digital rendition remains a different experience, the given work is still the given work as it's objectively understood as a philosophical entity and product of creative thought. For simplicity's sake, I won't conduct the wider "digital versus analog" dualist debate here.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>Moving Image Works as Capta</h3>
        <p>According to scientific method approaches to inquiry, we can equate the accumulation of derived still-images from these moving image works as our "datasets." However, Johanna Drucker's definition of <i>data as capta</i> provides a more suitable definition for the inquiry conducted within this project. According to Drucker, "humanistic inquiry acknowledges the situated, partical, and consitutive character of knowledge production, the recognition that knowledge is constructed, taken, not simply given as a natural representation of a pre-existing fact." Data is assumed to be a "given"&mdash;recorded and observed; capta is "taken" actively&mdash;to engage and analyze.
        <br>
        <br>
        The use of capta per Drucker's definition grounds the use of the moving image work case studies first and foremost as <i>artist-made works</i> used primarily to answer humanities-based questions about film as aesthetic works. In addition, understanding data as an active process rather than having a passive existence is key to our interpretation of these works within the analysis. It allows the works to keep their visual and historical richness inherent to their existence during the process of inquiry rather than being reduced to static objects for the sake of digital technicality.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Reproductions vs. Revisualizations</h3>

        <p>Scholar and critic Walter Benjamin argued in his seminal essay "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" that the act of reproducibility presented something new and that the aura, the unique aesthetic authority of a work of art, could be absent from a mechanically generated copy. In the vein Benjmain's line of thought, the process of inquiry proposed here <i>does not aim to reproduce the works</i>, therefore works in question keep their distinct auras. The visual elements included here are what I define as <i>revisualizations</i>, rather than reproductions. Revisualization illustrates there are more visible qualities to understand about these works, and this is where the digital humanities can step in and help fill a gap.</p>
       <br>
       <h2>Frames, "Frames," and Still-Images</h2>

       <p><i>Frames</i> are the individual frames as we've come to understand them within celluloid media forms, as seen in <b>Figure 2</b>. Through the act of deformance, we generate derivatives for this project. Thus, <i>"frames"</i> is the term used when the derivatives are illustrated on ImagePlot and <i>still-images</i> is the term used when derivatives are created through FFmpeg. You can read more about the tools used in Methods.
        <br>
        <br>
        The word <i>frames</i> itself has been used in various contexts, which is why I found it important to define the terms and draw boundaries here. The use of the term within the media industry and its related fields are far different than what many traditional users and consumers may understand it to mean. Notably, digital video also uses frames per second standards as units of measurement. However, for the purposes of this project, we'll stick to the definition of frames as understood within celluloid mediums.
