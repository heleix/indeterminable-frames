        <h2>Generating Images From a Digital Video File</h2>

        <p>To derive a number of still-images from a digital video file, I used <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/" target="_blank">FFmpeg</a>, an open-source command line tool for multimedia files. Below is the command I entered on the command line interface (CLI) to accomplish the task.
	       <pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputvideo.mp4 -vf fps=1 directory/outputname_%03d.png</code></pre>

        <p>
        This command can be understood as separate parts:
        <br>
        <br>
        <code>ffmpeg</code> = tells the CLI we will be entering a command prompt for FFmpeg
        <br>
        <br>
        <code>-i inputvideo.mp4</code> = the <code>-i</code> indicates we will be using a file input and then we bring the video file into the command using its exact name and format
        <br>
        <br>
        <code>-vf fps=1</code> = the video filter (<code>-vf</code>) tool on FFmpeg will sample 1 image for every second of the file, i.e. fps = "frames per second"
        <br>
        <br>
        <code>directory/outputname_%03d.png</code> = specifies the directory where the derivative still-images are saved, a numerically ordered naming convention (<code>%03</code> dictates that the ordinal number of each output will be formatted using 3 digits, e.g. outputname_001, outputname_002, and so on), and the file format for the images (.jpg, .png, etc.).
        <br>
        <br>
        I was able to find the necessary command thanks to the <a href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Create%20a%20thumbnail%20image%20every%20X%20seconds%20of%20the%20video" target="_blank">FFmpeg wiki</a> and <a href="https://amiaopensource.github.io/ffmprovisr/#multi_thumbnail" target="_blank">ffmprovisr</a>, a repository of FFmpeg commands for archivists created by the Association of Moving Image Archivists (AMIA) Open Source Committee.

        <h2>Image Macroanalysis in Javascript</h2>

        <p><a href=http://www.zachwhalen.net/pg/imj/# target="_blank">Image Macroanalysis in Javascript (IMJ)</a> is a web-based tool created by Zach Whalen.
        <br>
        <br>
        According to Whalen's website, IMJ is a "movie barcode generator, montage generator, and image analyzer/plotter for creating visualizations for your large image sets." Its creation was inspired by <a href="http://lab.softwarestudies.com/p/imageplot.html" target="_blank">ImagePlot</a>, a free software tool for visualizing collections and exploring patterns within image collections. However, IMJ's browser-based graphic user interface makes it a more accessible and user-friendly visulization tool. The generator allows users to generate a Barcode, Montage, or Plot visualization style. This project's visualizations utilizes the Barcode setting.
        <br>
        <br>
        The aesthetic qualities of these images have since been popularized by blogs such as <a href="https://moviebarcode.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">moviebarcode</a> on Tumblr. However, the blog includes primarily feature-length works, features little to no amateur or experimental film/video works, and includes no textual analysis of the generated images.

        <h2>ImagePlot for ImageJ</h2>


        <p><a href=http://lab.softwarestudies.com/p/imageplot.html target="_blank">ImagePlot</a> is a free software tool that visualizes and explores patterns in large image collections. The software runs as a macro (which, in computer science, is a rule or pattern that specifies how a certain input will be mapped to an output) that works with <a href=https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/ target="_blank">ImageJ</a>. ImageJ is an open source Java-based image processing program developed at the National Institutes of Health, originally created for scientific image analysis.
        <br>
        <br>
        ImagePlot was developed by the <a href=http://lab.softwarestudies.com/ target="_blank">Software Studies Initiative</a>, a research lab and design studio working on the analysis of cultural datasets and to advance the theoretical analysis of how software systems shape contemporary cultural and social life.</p>
